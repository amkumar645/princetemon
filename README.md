# Princetemon

Princetémon is a Princeton-themed top-down role-playing video game (RPG). Inspired by the plot-driven and interactive nature of Pokémon, as well as landmarks of Princeton’s campus, Princetémon consists of several scenes and mini-games that are navigated by an individual player, who is a student at Princeton University. In order to enter Frist Campus Center, which has been locked by Christopher Nolan’s filming crew, the student must complete mini-games to collect props necessary for entrance from various locations on campus, such as Poe Field (where they have to dodge construction debris), The Street (where they have to learn a dance choreography), and Prospect Garden (where they avoid water piranhas that have infested the fountain). Visually, the game has a retro 8-bit pixelated style.
